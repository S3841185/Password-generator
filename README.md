Hello and welcome to my password checker.

This is just for fun and by no means a secure password generator or manager, this is just for me as a cybersecurity student to learn coding and scripting.

Future plans for this project are:

1. add options to include or exclude numbers or symbols
2. add the ability to generate more than one password at a time
3. add a menu system to generate, view, update or delete a password (CRUD)
4. write passwords to a file
5. add a GUI
6. potentially add the choice to add a passphrase generator as well
7. fix bugs for input handling
